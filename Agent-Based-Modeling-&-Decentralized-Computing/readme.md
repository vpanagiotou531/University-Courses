The course is addressed to students who want to get in touch with contemporary issues concerning the theoretical foundations of decentralized/distributed computation and modeling. The goal is for students to get in touch with advanced topics concerning first distributed and then decentralized computation. At the same time they will become familiar with various decentralized models in order to describe their basic characteristics and properties and how such models are in turn used to describe real physical/artificial systems. In addition, special emphasis will be given from a modelling perspective to the implementation of such models in NetLogo, so that in addition to theoretical analysis, students will be able to evaluate a model of a system through extensive experimentation.


Distributed Computation :
We will look at somewhat more advanced distributed computing topics including (but not limited to): distributed computing models (LOCAL, CONGEST) The Maximal Independent Set problem (nature-inspired algorithm) Self-Stabilization Population Protocols

Decentralized Computation :
We will deal more with protocols where control is not centralized. In this context the topics we will deal with include.


Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) :
Basic principles related to agent-based modeling of natural/artificial systems. NETLOGO will be used to present relevant topics including: basic NETLOGO programming tools and simple models (e.g., ant foraging model, Life, Heroes and Cowards, Simple Economy) More advanced models and basic concepts of agent-based modeling and simulation (Fire model, DLA model, Segregation model, El Farol model). The basic components of an ABM: agents, environments and interactions. The predator-prey model. Analysis of a model (epidemiological models). The BehaviorSpace tool to perform several experiments to properly parameterize the model.
