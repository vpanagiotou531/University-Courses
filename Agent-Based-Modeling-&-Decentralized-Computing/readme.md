The course is addressed to students who want to get in touch with contemporary issues concerning the theoretical foundations of decentralized/distributed computation and modeling. The goal is for students to get in touch with advanced topics concerning first distributed and then decentralized computation. At the same time they will become familiar with various decentralized models in order to describe their basic characteristics and properties and how such models are in turn used to describe real physical/artificial systems. In addition, special emphasis will be given from a modelling perspective to the implementation of such models in NetLogo, so that in addition to theoretical analysis, students will be able to evaluate a model of a system through extensive experimentation.
