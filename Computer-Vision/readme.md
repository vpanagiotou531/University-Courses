- **Photometry, Shading, and Color**
- **Parametric Curves and Surfaces**
- **Multidimensional Processing Systems, Multidimensional Linear Systems, and Fourier Analysis**, with an emphasis on Gabor filters and wavelet transformations. Multi-scale image analysis, image pyramids.
- **Stereopsis and Multi-View Geometry**, Scene reconstruction from two images and from multiple images.
- **Alignment - Registration, Geometric Image Distortions, Affine Transformations, Projection Transformations, Mosaics, Image Morphing**
- **Feature Matching, Feature Detection, Finding Corresponding Features, Using Corresponding Points for Alignment**, Desired Properties of Detectors, Desired Properties of Descriptors, Harris Corner Detector, Auto-correlation Matrix and Eigenvalue Analysis, Corner and Blob Features, Scale-Invariant Features and Scale Invariant Transformation (SIFT), Laplacian, DoG, and SURF Detectors
- **High-Resolution Image Synthesis from Low-Resolution Image Sequences**
