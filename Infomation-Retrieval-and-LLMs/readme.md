This is the repo for the "Information Retrieval" university course.
It contains the lab project, which uses advanced python coding (vector space model) & colBERT with specific metrics for text retrieval from datasets.

Course outline:
**Introductory Concepts**  
(User process, logical representation of texts, retrieval process). Performance evaluation metrics for retrieval (recall, precision, mean average precision, R-precision, precision histograms, harmonic mean, user-oriented metrics). 

**Information Retrieval Models**  
- **Set-theoretic Models**: Boolean model, fuzzy set model, extended Boolean model.
- **Algebraic Models**: Vector space model, latent semantic indexing model.
- **Probabilistic Models**
- **Machine Learning Techniques in Information Retrieval**: Learning to Rank, language models, word embeddings (such as word2vec, CBOW, skip-gram), LSTM, Transformers, BERT, GPT, reasoning search.
- **Information Retrieval on the World Wide Web**

**Web Search Engines**  
(Crawler, indexer). The HITS algorithm (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search). The Google search engine (PageRank scoring method). SALSA algorithm, **Lexical Indexing** (inverted files, signature files, bitmaps).

**Storage Techniques in Distributed Information Retrieval**  
(MapReduce, Apache Spark), **Full Indexing** (suffix trees, suffix array, Directed Acyclic Word Graphs (DAWG) for strings).

**String Indexing in Secondary Memory**  
(Super Suffix Array, B-tree for prefixes, B-tree for strings).

**Text Compression and Indexing Structures**, Text Mining.
