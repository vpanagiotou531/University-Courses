This is the repository for the "Graph Signal Processing & Machine Learning" course.
It contains the lab projects & the exercises of the course

The aim of the course is to acquire the knowledge needed to create a suitable background to analyse and define signal processing problems using graphs representing in a natural way the structure of signals such as multimodality (reception from different types of sensors), location of reception and processing of information or time dependence. They will also be able to consolidate and then transfer and generalise the basic principles of signal processing to problems in which data can be represented using graphs. Such problems are those involving the acquisition of data via sensor networks, distributed processors, social networks, time series, etc.

Upon successful completion of the course a student will be able to:

apply the basic elements of graph theory to signals understand the physical meaning of representing signals with graphs (multimodality, temporal/spatial proximity, etc.) 
understand the definition of systems in graphs and their generalization from classical signal and system theory (types of systems, Z transformation, filter design) understand the mathematical and physical meaning of signals represented by graphs, 
to generalise the concepts of stochastic processes in graphs 
to be able to understand the concepts of sampling and reconstruction in graphs 
to understand the operation of neural networks in graphs 
to be able to develop appropriate graphs from signals.
to be able to develop applications that make use of graphs with software tools.
